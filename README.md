# Particle Classification Using PCA and Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

In this project, we will classify particles into gamma (signal) or hadrons (background). Given that the features are correlated, we will perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain a new set of features and select those that contain the most information. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, as described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).

## Tasks Done

### 1. Investigate the Data

- Load the dataset and inspect the data structure, including feature names and target values.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their correlations.

### 2. Preprocess the Data

- Handle missing values if any.
- Standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### 3. Perform PCA

- Apply PCA to the standardized data to reduce dimensionality.
- Determine the number of principal components to retain based on the explained variance ratio.

### 4. Select Principal Components

- Select the principal components that contain the most information.
- Transform the original data using the selected principal components.

### 5. Train a Classifier

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a logistic regression classifier on the training set using the selected principal components.
- Evaluate the classifier's performance on the testing set.

### 6. Evaluate Model Performance

- Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the classifier's performance.
